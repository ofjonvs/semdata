Tires peel skin off your back

This heat gon' make you get back
Haunted Mound in your town, I won't step down for no bitch
Uh, uh, bored as fuck, I need them drugs, I call my witch
Cathedral livin', waking in the morning all just for some sip
"Turn, stop rapping 'bout that lean," shut the fuck up, you lil' bitch (Shut the fuck up)
Motherfucker, it's time to end your life with wrenched fucking gripe
Groupie bitches, stay away from me, I don't care, I love my wifе
Money always gon' be worthless, hundrеd bucks is on your wishlist
If I won the lottery then I would burn the fucking ticket

Fuck the world and everyone in it, I'ma go to hell
My lungs black from chain-smoking, I say, "Oh well"
When I die, give me my cutter and my iced out blangy belt
Told that stupid bitch, "This dick ain't gonna suck itself"
But I can't even feel it, off Oxy, I'm Napolean
I'm with my revenants, tote wire bats at 3 AM
You hate your life? I'll set you free from your skin prison
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha

I don't care 'bout sleep no more, I don't give a fuck

Digging out a plot in triple six Haunted Mound clubhouse
Didn't believe in me then, so why the fuck would you now?
The Mound got chainsaws and Glocks, go, "Rah, rah, bow"
I see an opp over yonder, let's go get him now

Since I was ten, lil' nigga never liked a jake
I'm in yo' state farming bitches, nigga, like I'm Jake
I'm in a sitcom, finna cop a Debbie Kay
A lot of shit gone, nigga shoot with double Dracs
She finna' bend over, then I put it in her face
If I put Cartier's on, then how can I get mid
If I don’t rock the Saint Peter, how can I be lit?
If I ain't bussin' a bitch, then how can she be late?
Before I eat, man, you know it's always “As-salamu alaykum”
24/8, bitch, I'm always ballin' like a Laker

I love my mama, but I ain't tell her that I made it
I love these bitches, you see niggas, they so basic
I light his frontal up, and you know I face it
I fucked this lil' hoe up, think she was Jamaican
I make this Drac' go “Vrrah”, where his body lay
I don’t wear makeup, nah, but I look amazing
All of these white diamonds, everybody think I'm racist
Gotta go raw, 'cause I'm making everybody fake
Put it on God, I'm in everybody fucking brain
I got my nails done, everybody swear I'm gay
I told lil' twin, “Let's take it right back to the basics”
Bullets say, "Haha", young nigga did not kick
You poppin', I land, and I'm fucking on an eight
My mom, she hate me, I'm bad at communicating
You tell the cops sumn’, you'll always be a bitch
I told the crab fiends, "Uncle told me how to mix"
I told my main bitch, "Let's go have a blasian baby"
I like a G-Shock, but I think this shit outdated
You so feline, how it feel to get cremate?
Bitch, in my free time, I be boolin' with yo' bae
But it’s the street time, smoking with a non-fake
I need some me time, told this bitch, "I cannot fake"
I hit her three times, three times, now she can't even take it
Put this on rewind, [?]
I told Elon, bitch, we finna make a spaceship

I'ma stay true 'til the end
Flannel blowing in the wind
By the house of the dead
I know that they will forget
All about the burlap man
Buried down behind the shack
Angеls carved all in the wood
I remеmber coming here way before these days began
Scarecrow, I don't got no friends
Cornfields where I like to stay
Drag you through the woods
Carve my name deep in your skin
Woah, woah
There's no angels at home
Woah, woah
In your backyard, scarecrow

Angelmaker in my holster, Vector mag make your brain splat (Bow)

Smokin', burnin' the cigarettes, smoke dust all up in my pack
Scratch the number off my angelmaker, got a shell catcher, now you in the past

[Chorus: Sematary]
Big iron on my hip, I'll see you in the whip, I'll make you a angel
On my left and my right and my side, some motherfuckin' angel maker
Smokin' on cancer, smokin' on your ashes, gettin' fucked up in the graveyard
I don't wanna live forever so try me, boy, probably meet your maker
Big iron on my hip, I'll see you in the whip, I'll make you a angel

[Verse]
Layin' awake, I lie awake in my room for several days
I'm pushin' off my own decay and starin' though my window pane
I'm hexed away, my vision fade
Heart rippin' through my ribcage
Another dawn begins to break
My shadow cast an empty stain
Perceived and carried out by my panicked inner stricken self
Just above the fireplace, your ashes on an empty shelf
Huffin' on some solvent at the back of the station
I don't wanna turn up, I want derealization
I saw the sky turning red in the night
I hear banshees, they're weeping, and grieving and crying
I watched hundreds of doves dropping dead from the sky
I felt nothing, no presence from inside my mind (Oscar)

From the hill, ’round the way where you left your dog
I got knives, if you try me, you will fall
I am unrepentant, always screaming "Fuck it all"
Don't step to me, stomp you with my New Rocks (Ha)
I see angels in the sky but they're too far

Who goes there, scratching underneath the floor?
Don't speak to me, nerves on a razor wire
Eyes pierce the night, mouth made of fire
Ghost Mountain, ah, death's wagon
Why you try at all, can you hear the trees laughin'?
Smoke Sabbath, I been feeling absent
Finna end it all, find me in my cabin
Fuck your flag and your life don't matter
Pigs gon' burn, Nazi skulls gon' shatter
I been sick for days, bright lights come together
Tear my throat out, I can finally feel better
White crosses on the shore, storm follows in the night
Grave Man on the hill with a box cutter knife
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, bitch, do you wanna die?
Broken angel hospital, fading back into the light

Wrapped in barbed wire

Pierce the night, go and sleep until it hurts you
I'm the creak beneath the floorboards of my room
Coiled up vertebrae in a corkscrew

We don't pull up, we just run up, our cutters thirst for blood
Bitch, I'm still babayaga with my cutter up
Bitch, I'm still in the night, you know it's fuck the sun
Haunted Mound murder thugs, we'll murder you just for fun
If I told you I loved you then I was high as fuck
And all my opps are fucking fans, man, what the fuck?
My cutter cut the world for me, it is my one true love

Haugh
Haugh 

[Verse 1: Sematary]
I  done bought some knives
I might buy some guns
Watch what you say, homie, I'm not stable
Wake  up in the morning, what have I become?
I'll  cut your head off with a Husqvarna
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, we go fuckin' dumb
We  ride around in the night, lookin' for some fun
Get out the way of the Jeeper Creeper truck
Whole world's burning down, we don't give a fuck
Pandemonium, lost my mind, think I died in the cemetarium
I  swear to god, I think I'm the scary one
Got a box cutter so I could make the river red run
I swear to god, you'll be dead by dawn
Nobody worth a fuck
We're just some randoms, you'll never know us
I see through the fake, so I call that slut rot
Oogie Boogie Man lurkin' in your trash slum

[Chorus: Ghost Mountain]
Dead by dawn, you'll be dead by dawn
Cabin in the woods, never see the sun
Floatin' in the water, what have we become?
In the treehouse, I don't speak to no one
Dead by dawn, you ain't got long
Dancin' in the moonlight, Black Swan
Haunted Mound rottin' in the Autumn
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, watch 'em all pass on
Dead by dawn, you'll be dead by dawn
Cabin in the woods, never see the sun
Floating in the water, what have we become?
In the treehouse, I don't speak to no one
Dead by dawn, you ain't got long
Dancing in the moonlight, Black Swan
Haunted Mound rottin' in the Autumn
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, watch 'em all pass on

My veins bleed oil, world rush to my rescue
Nail your kisses to me, I can die in the arms of you
Watching the trees pass away in the rear-view
Cutter with 5 blades, you know what he do
Pull up in Prius, you ain't hear us
If you see us, it's your skins up
Black Swans dance for us, Faygo pours for us
We got our masks up, we are the Nazgûl
Sew my arms up, number Nine, like the ragdoll
Fuck the whole world, let's get gone, watch the world fall
All these orbs around, what'd you put in my Red Bull?
We're still in the night, you can cry but we still ball
To power my dead brain, inject Red Bull, my shoulder blades
That's a nice high but I don't need wings
I'm not a heaven man, I am the crooked man
I'm from the haunted mound you buried your dog at

[Chorus: Ghost Mountain]
Dead by dawn, you'll be dead by dawn
Cabin in the woods, never see the sun
Floatin' in the water, what have we become?
In the treehouse, I don't speak to no one
Dead by dawn, you ain't got long
Dancin' in the moonlight, Black Swan
Haunted Mound rottin' in the Autumn
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, watch 'em all pass on
Dead by dawn, you'll be dead by dawn
Cabin in the woods, never see the sun
Floating in the water, what have we become?
In the treehouse, I don't speak to no one
Dead by dawn, you ain't got long
Dancing in the moonlight, Black Swan
Haunted Mound rottin' in the Autumn
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, watch 'em all pass on
[Verse 3: Ghost Mountain]
Coffin rock, cough it up
I saw the devil, through the woods, in his black truck
We'll give you back to the earth, dog, you outta luck
Set fire to the house, never give a fuck
We some sad clowns, totems all around
Find her by the water, feet never touch the ground
Back road family in a ghost town
New dawn fades over Haunted Mound
Call me buddy, cave your face in
Walk up to your house, mask made of face skin
Dirt road turning up, comin' round the bend
Last chapter, boy, better face the end
Bury you like the cat underneath the great pine
Somethin' comin' out the pond, think we running outta time
Fucked up in the field, think I lost my damn mind
Devil's rejects, death, leave me behind1

[Verse 1: Sematary]
Shotgun where my bitch sit
Paralyzed up in my bed
White knuckles on the wheel grip
Ridin' all around through dead trees
I don't snort shit, I pop shit
Walkin' 'round, Rocks and Robins
Baby, you can't tell me shit
Baby, I need a six of red, please
Baby, I need a cigarette, please
Baby, I need your love, please
Don't fade away like dead trees
Please, don't fade away like dead trees
All I ever see is dead trees
And you know that fire walk with me
I'm your friend 'til the end like Chucky
I'm his opp to the end like Frеddy
And you know they'll never clip my wings
And you know thеy'll always try to hurt me
For you, I'm so bruised and bloody
Even when you're so far away from me
Baby, promise me that you won't leave
I swear on the Mound, I won't leave
Say you won't fade away like dead trees

Buck, Buck
Off a headlight, eyes widen
Your face falls white, you're frightened
My mouth dries up, I'm silent
It passes by, don't fight it
Sunset, sunrise, sun rising
I can't sleep off this Vyvanse
I toss and turn just tryin'
All I wanted was a thousand meter wingspan
She doing my drugs, Judy Garland
Crowbar motel out in Kansas
Smoking painkillers off of foil, man
Good dope, number three from Afghan
She likes me better when I'm half-dead
Singing through the holes in my head
In-between her eyes, in my bed
Her skin, her bones, her spine bends
From the corner of my eye to the back of my mind
You've got nowhere left to run and you wish you could hide
D-Dying in my room, checking my vital signs
Does your hand still feel familiar in mine?
[Chorus: Sematary]
Dead trees, dead trees
Please, don't fade away like dead trees
Dead trees, dead trees
Please, don't fade away like dead trees

9 DISORDER Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide
To come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel
The pleasures of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me
For another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling
Take the shock away
Haugh, haugh

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, getting faster
Now it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs
It's a no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing
Getting frequent now
I've got thе spirit, lose the feeling
Let it out somеhow
Haaugh

[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me
And we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her
I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell
And who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
Haugh

15 DOES Lyrics[Intro: Turnabout]
There's blood all over my clothes
There's blood all over your clothes
You ain't ever been to the Haunted Mound
Hauntaholics, Real Haunted Mound

[Chorus: Turnabout]
You got blood all over them clothes
There's blood all over my clothes
A ghost left through his nose
Sending souls to the north pole

His face turn white like snow whеn the blood run out the nose

Y'all been actin like some hoes
We come creeping like the does

[Verse 1: Turnabout]
Blood run out his eyes, he get to decaying
Snuffer, Goner, Hackledown, what the fuck you saying?
Coven of the crows, and they know where you staying
I send souls to the north pole, and my fucking Harold hanging
There's something scouting from the bushes
It's something you can't fathom
I'm disappearing like a phantom
You can't find me if you wanted (like you want it)
Turnabout knows the whereabouts of your house
So where you going?
Harold swinging, Hell raising
These lames complaining, we get to spraying
Shoot your head while I'm headbanging
My True gon' change
But I ain't ever changing (Turnabout)

Percorri galáxias, esqueci de viver
Na minha máxima, vais-te enlouquecer
Tudo o que faço, é para te proteger
Futuro presente, passado a morrer
Hashtags on a star, nós estamos tipo Star Wars
Mas vocês vão copiar, tipo, Clone Wars
Vamos estar sempre a brilhar, always shining nevermore
Hashtags on a star, can't stop it anymore

[Verse 2: Sematary]
Haaaauuuughhh
Sema-Sema-Sematary, I don't ever look up at the stars
Hell to reign, fuckboy wanna try, you got hell to pay
Fuck today, my neck turning green from my stupid chain
I can say anything as long as it has meaning
I don't look up at the stars, you could never go this hard
I only use a cutter, I don't need no firearms
Comin' in your house, break you down with a crowbar

Reaching for that third to back
When will fear bring to the end
Leave my drink up on the curb, waiting for the tampering
Kick your door in, еnd your world
Take your soul, just say the word
You think I'm bad, I'm far from worst
You gon' feel etеrnal hurt, southeast of the ruined trees
Smoke cigs, same color as dirt
From dust we grow, to dust return
I'm gon' send you down to purgatory, that’s your final home

I’m the god of my fucking girl
Whip my truck off a cliff
Get back up, 'cause I don’t feel no hurt
I always felt like king so I start acting like it
Take a fuckin' staff and put your head up on it
The world's a fucking joke until young Turnabout went and stepped upon it
Lord of Ephraim, they all fear, they all gon' be fuckin' quiet
I can make you feel the hurt, I can make you feel the pain
One in the head straight through you brain

Tryna place me in a tomb, buried for eternity

26 FLOWERS Lyrics[Intro: Ghost Mountain]
I'm on the Rainbow Bridge

[Chorus: Sematary]
I woke up this morning still above the ground
Smoking on your ashes, laughin' at the world (Haugh)
Nothing ever grows over on the haunted mound (Haunted Mound)
Laughing through the flowers on the hallowed ground
I'll put you in the flowers
I'll put you in the flowers
I'll put you in the flowers, the flowers, the flowers
I'll leave you in the flowers (Ahh)

[Verse: Ghost Mountain]
Ribcage, collar bone
Bleached white, forgotten, buried all alone
Got nine Mondays 'til we decomposе
Feed you to the soil on the hill wherе nothing grows (Oh)
Haunted Mound where I come from
Where the leaves fall red with the set sun
Past the pines, on the river bed
Grave House in the middle of the farmstead
Reap the Earth, skin the hide, how it should be
Keep yourself occupied, keep yourself busy
Death's wagon comin', chains like I'm Jacob Marley
I'm fuckin' arcane, from the woods, I'm a grizzly
Trace the blood, four feet, call me shallow
Underground, things feeding deep in the meadow
Ivory, down below, hear the owls
I'll put you down to sleep beneath the flowers

Barbed wire baseball bat, I'ma break your damn brain
Send you down to the fire, goofy, it's your last day
I just bought a shirt, gon' wear it for like fifty days
Everything I ever wear is older than Me
My body is a graveyard, old clothes all-day
Got my one true friend and my OTF blade
I'll make red mist cover the whole town
Got the Babadook hands in the haunted mound
He toy with me so you laid him to the ground

[Outro: Purdue Pharma Spokesman & Turnabout]
Turnabout
Once you've found the right doctor
And you've told him or her about your pain
Don't be afraid to take what they give you
Often, it will be an opioid medication
Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
Because they're perceived as too strong or addictive
But that is far from actual fact
Less than 1% of patients taking opioids actually become addicted
And any drowsiness that might occur when you start to take the medication
Will soon wear off for most patients

Hackle got the titty drum, I'm coming with that cleaver
Bitch, I'm a people hater
Try the Haunted Mound, motherfucker, we soul takers
I'm riding with that heater
Cadillac DeVille, run your bitch ass over
In the forest like Baba Yaga
But it's California, bury you in Appalachia
Oxy in my Coca-Cola
Creeping at the Arco, pissing on your gravestone
Lord have mercy on my wicked soul
Nine on me, knives on me, B.B. belt got silver skull
Blood sparkle off the glare of my fucking chrome
Put it on my headstone, bitch, I said fuck the world

And I swear she hold me down

27 HALLOW’D GROUND Lyrics[Intro: Buckshot & Sematary]
(Ha-Ha-Ha-Hauntaholics, Real Haunted Mound)
(I walk on hallowed ground, with that cutter on me, don't play around)
(I'm stealing catalytic converters from the impound)
I walk on hallowed ground
I walk on hallowed ground, I'm walkin' on, I'm walkin' on

[Chorus: Buckshot]
I walk on hallowed ground, with that cutter on me, don't play around
I'll skim your credit card and empty out your whole account
I'll raid your medicine cabinets if I'm in your house
Overamped in the Butcher House, it's a party with the Haunted Mound
I walk on hallowed ground, with that cutter on me, don't play around
I'm stealing catalytic converters from the impound
Fuck a front door knocking, breaking down your door, comin' in your house
I'm poisoning the water well and killin' off the whole town

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Hallowеd ground, hallowed be thy name
Laid to rеst in a shallow grave
Cold case, wipe my DNA
Now I'm ballin' out, life insurance claim
What I'm off is neurotoxic
Point of return, too far beyond it
Empty blank eyes, unresponsive
All I hear is incoherent talkin'
Blood from a goat if you want a feature
Delirious off the drugs like I had a fever
Pills and alcohol, 'bout to have a seizure
Sleepin' under old prehistoric structure
I got Benzedrex and lemon juice
Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Concerta
Overampin', I'm getting anxious
Footsteps, voices, did you hear that? (Haunted Mound)
In an RV at the truck stop
Mix Sudafed and red phosphorus
I ain't sleepin', I'm speedin'
Eyes won't close, starin' at the ceiling
Forgive us for our trespasses
Hallowed ground, we trespassin'
Stone circles and an ancient castle
Maypole midsummer dancin'

[Verse 2: Sematary]
I'm a rider, I'm a haunter, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry and I'll drink when I'm dry
And if living don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die
Haunted Mound, run in your house, I'm blowin' off my sawed-off
Cutter knife straight through your spine, I watch your eyes go hollow
Hollowed world still burnin' down, no fuck to give for sorrow
Goin' dumb forevermore, we're America's most haunted
Haunted Mound 'til I'm in the ground
Stay in Butcher House, we don't come around
Apparitions with hollow rounds
And hollow souls and haunted crowns
And ain't no grave can hold me down
We'll put your soul in hallowed ground
Skinwalker runnin' in your house
Better run when you hear that sound
[Chorus: Buckshot]
I walk on hallowed ground, with that cutter on me, don't play around

Hi, my name is Sematary
And I like gettin' high
Grave Man
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Hi, my name is Sematary, and I like gettin' high
I like ridin' hearse trucks, speedin' through the night
Hi, my name is Grave Man, and I say, "Fuck life"
I just wanna turn up and watch the headlights
You'll never be us, but I guess you can try
You can be my Haunted girl if you like my Haunted guys
Rock my hockey mask, but I still smile
World is on fire, but I'ma still try
I don't wanna look back, I just wanna drive
I need a cigarette and I just need to die
I feel like a deer lost in the headlights
Every single day of my motherfuckin' life

[Chorus]
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
All-All-All I see is headlights
All I see in the night is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive

Sia on the other side, my heart's not elastic
Going on an expedition, 2010 Zered Bassett, aye
Toothpick in my mouth like Cody and you know I keep a Mac
Entire group of jits done cleared the scene before I sneak attacked
And I’ll be getting cheese, spice it up, I buck the pepper jack
And swiss cheese him, switchy came from Switzerland, he interlaken
I’m going up but I’m still hitting coochie bare, call it polarizing
Ducked off on an island like I’m Akon, call it soul surviving
Striking with that stainless, but you know I’m not gon' bowl beside him
Slip, you hop up in that lane, that’s why I ain’t socializing
Open up the map, I’m about to take them underground
I’m in the capital cities clutching, I’m feeling safe and sound
I was walking Hillsboro but now I’m North Cali bound
I bought a brand new shovel, meet me at the Haunted Mound
What they say, ay!

I see you talkin' slick, partner, say a prayer

Head hanging low, fastened to my tired spine

Starin' at the sun, I'm feelin' good, I'm goin' blind
Cracks up in the wall, crawlin' up between my mind
Stealin' copper wire right off from the train tracks
Eatin' Adderall until I have a heart attack
Risen out, rise for me, sacrify, die with me
Horses walk away from me
Goats are starin' back at me

24 IN THE MORNING Lyrics[Intro]
(Haunted Mound)
Ah-ah-ah, Buck Buck
(Ha-Ha-Ha-Hauntaholics, real Haunted Mound) Ah

[Chorus]
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Lay 'em down, put the dog back to bed (Back to bed)
Euthanized, let the dog get some rest (Some rest)
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Hit the hay, burn the barn, go and call it a day (Ah-ah)
Garden hose, exhaust pipe, duct-taped to your face

[Verse 1]
Safe and sound, wait it out, burn the evidence
I'm layin' low and stayin' down until it passes
Broken hanging gate, swingin' off the latches
Burning barn, the grass is black in patches
Dark hours of the evening closin' in
Wildfires burnin' over way back where I should've been
I strike a match and then ignite it when my day begins
I stare into thousand yards, I'm getting sick again

[Chorus]
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Lay 'em down, put the dog back to bed (Back to bed)
Euthanized, let the dog get some rest (Some rest)
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Hit the hay, burn the barn, go and call it a day (Ah-ah)
Garden hose, exhaust pipe, duct-taped to your face

On the front porch, watching the world end
To the soul, written off, mark my covenant
From the pastures, I hear the livestock
Don't go in the lake, you can drown there
Rites of passage, trail walkin' through the county
Strayin' off the beaten track, they'll never find your body
Found footage underground, undisclosed location
Facedown floatin' like a needle in a basin

[Chorus]
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Lay 'em down, put the dog back to bed (Back to bed)
Euthanized, let the dog get some rest
I'm still gone early in the morning (Morning)
Buck eternal, do not ever mourn me (Mourn me)
Hit the hay, burn the barn, go and call it a day (Ah)
Garden hose, exhaust pipe, duct-taped to your face

*Phone hang-up*
Mmm
Turnabout

[Verse]
On the road of olde
I still see the souls
That drag me down far
I'm still down below
I reign in my town
I reign down in hell
I hear the final bell
I hear the screams and yells
God hit my fuckin' line
He said, "Turn, you're one of mine"
I listened wit' my eyes
I hung that fuckin' phone up and I started my reign
You either serve in heaven or you reign in hell
But the demons gon' shine for my BB belt
You don't know your fuckin' self, you can't even tell
Feel my fuckin' power, or just burn with the rest

[Chorus]
Till death do of me, I'll shine, I'm thuggin'
Tell me why the fuck the Spanish drop came from Poland?
Tell me why the fuck Turnabout always got a pole man?
Stop fuckin' bothering me to drop, you gon' hear it in a moment
Kiss my hands, baby
Get down, kiss my hands
My lil' lady baby wait because it's all part of the plan
Kiss my hands, baby
Get down, kiss my hands

It's a long walk home

[Chorus: Buckshot]
It's a long walk home
Make it back before dark, shortcut down the dirt road
Felt her breath in my arms on my collarbone
In the night, felt her eyes piercin' through my soul
It's a long walk home
Barbed wire guide me down a back road
In my room down the long dark hallway
Boarded up, wooden planks 'cross the doorway

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Empty bare room, cracks on the drywall
Broken flicker of a flame emitted through a lightbulb
Cracks in the wall, crawlin' through the ceilin'
In my mind, words of thought turn to scrеamin'
Deadweight hangin', tied to my spinе
Hollow shell of a skull cavin' in on my mind
Lay me down in the dirt, let 'em sing out a dirge
Fall asleep under the Earth, get through worst
Now it's all gone, what do you believe in?
Nothin' feels real anymore, what's the meanin'?
I'ma let it all pass like a season
Banshee at my window, still grievin', still weepin'

Boarded up, wooden planks 'cross the doorway

[Verse 2: Turnabout]
In the same room disassociating
Is this life I'm living really somethin' I created? (I created)
Lots ripped through my mind, fillin' me with hatred
Marrow on the bone saw, what a beautiful occasion
Me and Bucken, we don't give no fuck but we still pourin' up the Benzedrex (Benzedrex)
Feels like fent up on my can of bev
I think it's time to go to bed (Go to bed)
The ghosts done fuckin' left my house, I think I'll meet my spider friends again (Spider friends)
When the hat man in my house, he pleads for me to bring you to your end
There-There's eyes in the snow
The eyes across the hills are gonna glow like wendigos (Wendigos)
There's nowhere to go
So follow me on this long walk home

[Chorus: Buckshot]
It's a long walk home
Make it back before dark, shortcut down the dirt road

3 LURKER OF CHALICE GRANITE X GUCCI MANE NICKELODEON MASHUP Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
I paid twenty thousand dollars for this beat just to bang in the club, huh, whoa
Five thousand dollar for a chopper, man, I'm gonna shoot someone up, ha

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Wonder Woman bracelet match my He-Man watch
My Batman car made Catgirl stop
This Spiderman Kush is sticky as a spider web
And it's so loud that you can smell it in Fort Lauderdale
Three X-Men fell victim to my 40-cal
Little Smurfs trying to act like they were Gargamel
I'm Gat Man, Gucci know I keep a joker gun
The AK, nigga, loaded, shorty, REDRUM
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, that's Superman
Girlfriend, please, no, that's just Gucci Mane
My swag change like I'm rapping with another brain
I go hard, SpongeBob, nigga, you a lame
Like Garfield, homiе, Odie, nigga, I'm a dog
And what you call that? Man, I call it chicken talk
Like Bugs Bunny, big monеy, got a lot of cash
I shotgun like Elmer Fudd to kill these dirty wabbits

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Ha, Chicken Talk 2, nigga
It's Gucci, nigga
Feels like I'm in down-south 50 nigga
I feel like I'm east-side Busta Rhymes right now
Two chains on, three bracelets, nigga
In my two-seater, nigga
Copped it off the showroom floor, nigga
What's up, Marquis Daniels, I see you, nigga
Ball player money like I play for the Pacers with you, nigga

That cat with the pack mixed with an Isotol
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci just stole 80 pounds
If I could change a cartoon, I would change once
I made Jerry chase Tom with a handgun
Fifty-five tweety bird’s in my white truck
I'm still pissed cause my cousin stole my last blunt
I still got it like that nigga with that weak kush
Short temper, throwing fists like I'm Heathcliff
Selling babies in the six, call them Little Bills
Twelve-fifty for a baby, that's a good deal
A Transformer Benz sittin on some sick wheels
Bright yellow rims, same color my Bart Sim'
I say “Go-Go Gadget!” then a car brakes
Go stand there pussy nigga, step up to scar face

[Skit: Bigga Rankin & Gucci Mane]
Ayo, Gucci Mane, listen
I've got bad news, and I've got some good news
The good news is: your album sales just tripled
You got shows goin' overseas
Shit'll be poppin', nigga
The bad news is: your best friend's snitching on you
What are you gonna do 'bout that, my nigga?
Shit, everybody's snitching on me, nigga
I don't even keep no phone, nigga
My hoes can’t even keep up with me
It's Gucci, nigga
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
See I'm a junkyard dog, not a Scooby-Doo
I got that white girl, true, I'm talking Betty Boop
A hundred gallons of that yellow talking that Winnie-the-Pooh
So if I pull this hummer over I'mma make the news
The way I'm spittin' on the mic it's like I'm Daffy Duck
And I ain't Richie Rich, bitch, but I'm rich as fuck
Got Shawty Redd on the track, that's a lot of change
Then, man, this beat's gonna bang for a hundred days
Strip club, dance club, every DJ
Gucci Mane and Shawty Redd fucking let it play
Throw some money in the air, we gon' make it rain
Rotten niggas get sprayed trying to make a name
I stack it long, King Kong, then I took his chain
But I gave it back cuh, cause our diamonds weren’t the same
See you can keep it, man, I'm gonna step it up a tad
It's Gucci Mane and this song is Nickelodeon

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Shawty Lo, I know you ain't gonna let these niggas steal your sound
Broke ass niggas swag steal

My nigga hate to pay to see ya

Don't feel bad, I will die in the ambulance
Boy, I screwed up, I'm in Dog Heaven
If he play with me, I will not forgive him
Yeah, I made the beat, so it bang for 100 days

Satony writing on the wall

23 MY SHADOW Lyrics[Intro]
Hi, my name is Sematary, meet my fucking cutter saw
Sawed off AR pulled out, shawty, you know we got extra slugs
Black tee still on when I mob, New Rocks still on when I walk
Ghost Mountain said fuck 'em all, my shadow said let 'em burn

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning like it don't matter
Fuck the world, nobody try me, they know better
I don't do no stupid talk, I don't come around
It's just me, myself and I, plus my shadow
My shadow, my shadow
If I tried, I couldn't run from my shadow
My shadow, my shadow
Ain't got none to talk to, I talk to my shadow

[Verse 1]
I'm a Haunted Mound veteran, so you can't say beginner's luck
All my boys tote cutters, so your best bet is to pray to god
We could never give a fuck, empty-eyed Napoleon
Fifty-fifty chance I'ma snap if you fuck with us
Haunted Mound so dirty, dirty, put you on that gurney, gurney
Ambulance not fast enough, we did our own surgery
You can look all in my eyes, you cannot see anything
Shadow men stay true for you, we still gon' hate everything
Hi, my name is Sematary, meet my fucking cutter saw
Sawed off AR pulled out, shawty, you know we got extra slugs
Black tee still on when I mob, New Rocks still on when I walk
Ghost Mountain said fuck 'em all, my shadow said let 'em burn

Lord, lord knows that I'm trying hard
But god, god, I fucking hate it here
Chainsaw, I'm rocking Polo, I'm unrepentant
Lil' fuckboy wanna try me, give him Old Yeller
Bury him behind the barn, fucking spit on your grave
Find me in the seventh circle, I'm still gon' be flexing
Honda car whippin' 'round, all covered in corpse paint
Still in my bedroom, dying for a roommate
Keep your distance from me, shawty, you best stay away
Haunted Mound angels, I hope they are hearing me
Shadow stay true to me when everybody else leaves
And when I leave my house, my shadow will come with me

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning like it don't matter

Towering redwoods immortal
Growing cold gaining on your heels now

Chant out to the worlds in between
Buried in space, drown it out in gasoline

Black earth that made us, feel our wrath
Take you down the back road to skincarver ranch
Hello, pretty lady, do my skinwalker dance
Sure would be a shame if you walked down my path
The dark so heavy you can't even light a match
Black goat of the woods with a barbed wire bat
We got murder tools, cutters, guillotine you in half
Orange juice and gasoline mixin' in the back
Take the good with the bad, enjoy it while it lasts
Try the Haunted Mound Nazgul, it gon' end bad

Because a spider is on it and I'm hearin' it talkin
Sayin' that if I take the road not walked, I'll never regret it
Hear in the distance, an engine, and it's me who is revving

So be careful where you walking, you just leaving some evidence
On Olde Highway 28, I can hear them footsteps

[PART VI: Adam's Song - blink-182]

[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

26 PARKING LOT SCARECROW Lyrics[Intro]
Grave Man in this bitch, yeah
Posted up, parking lot like a scarecrow
H-H-Hauntaholics, real Haunted Mound
I'm a parking lot scarecrow, leave me alone

[Chorus]
Posted up, parking lot, like a scarecrow
Like a scarecrow, like a scarecrow
I'm a parking lot scarecrow, leave me alone

Like a scarecrow, like a scarecrow
I'm a parking lot scarecrow, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Posted in the field, but it ain't a cornfield
It's a Cadillac graveyard made of rusty steel
I'm a scarecrow, baby, but I'll be a man for you, girl
Grave Man, bitch, I'm a scarecrow for real
I can't feel my heart, but it's beating for something
Since I was a little kid, been drinking Robitussin
Don't ask me 'bout shit 'cause I don't remember nothing
I don't need my heart, I'm a gasoline tin man
Tryna be a better man but I'm on four pills
Riding through the burning hills, I don't really give a damn
I told her, "Come over," then I didn't say shit
'Cause my mask talk for me, is you fucking scared, bitch?

I don't see shit except your spirit
Who'd you come with and who'd you leave with?
Haunt the parking lot, bitch, Haunted Mound shit
Draggin' off a pill, chin stuck to my chest
I'm nodding off like a bitch, I don't sleep, I just rest
I got all these knives on me, got more weapons than friends
Watch McDonald's burn where the sidewalks ends
Smoking by the Arco, I think it's 'round four
Is anyone out there? I don't really know
If you hate the world, then you'll know what I know
And I feel your pain if you a real scarecrow

[Chorus]
Posted up, parking lot, like a scarecrow
Like a scarecrow, like a scarecrow
I'm a parking lot scarecrow, leave me alone

You trust me and you think I'm real
So close still
But you help me when I'm feeling ill

[Verse 2]
So I stay wasted, can't face it
La-La-Laced it, still taste it

[Chorus: Sematary]
I’m in the earth, man, I'm in the Haunted Mound

[Verse 1: Sematary]
My pants cost a human life
I'll pay for your funeral rites
I say "Let's get gone tonight"
Let's stay up for 7 nights
I’ve been up for 14 nights
Don't worry, I'm fine
I face everything and rise
I'm still lurkin' in the night
Live, laugh, love, fuck your life
I've got a whole bunch of knives
My crooked man is out tonight
New Rock custom, made for mine
Back from the place beneath the pines
Here, everything is fine
I will bleed you, knuckles white
I bleed to know that I'm alive
Scarecrows in Michigan
I'm screwed up, I'm in dog heaven
I'll be back, I rise again
I'm Sematary Grave Man
Tornado jeans, skin mask
Now it's me and the rats
Slow down the song, it's too fast
Got some shit in my cargo pants
Driving on an empty road
Fuck the cops, we let them go
Vodka, Red Bull, parking lot
All my clothes are made of rot
Fuck a cop, New Rocks, I stomp 'em
When they get me, they'll say "We got him"
Bury me and Ghost Mountain
I'll be fuckin' back tomorrow

Bones in my ashtray, this gon' be your last day
Silence and remorse, cop brains on my Air Forces

Fuck every pig, every fed, every cop
Tryna lock me up, hands up, handcuffed
Try to tell me sum' 'bout disorderly conduct
But I will never stop, no, still fuck the law
Fuck this whole town, ain't shit to do
Everything's the same and nothin' ain't new
Call my Haunted Mound like, "What's the move?"
Ride around in the night sniffin' bags of glue
We be turnin' up by the forest in the pines
Drinking turpentine, getting gone 'til it's bright
Haunted Mound boys on a haunted hayride
Having bad days but I'm feelin' alright

Walk around, up at night, living for the dead
Come with me, take me by the hand
From the corner of my eyes, saw a shadow man
I'm risen, I'm a revenant
No salvation, execration, I do not repent
Dead and buried, state of calamity
Behind the house and by the barn, backyard tragedy

I'm risen, I'm a revenant
Walk around, up at night, living for the dead
Come with me, take me by the hand
From the corner of my eyes, saw a shadow man
I'm risen, I'm a revenant
No salvation, execration, I do not repent
Dead and buried, state of calamity
Behind the house and by the barn, backyard tragedy
[Outro]
I'm risen, I'm the revenant
I'm the revenant
I'm the revenant
I'm the revenant

Girl, for me, stay true
And, baby, I'll kill for you
Batter up, wire bat to your dome
But I'm probably better off alone
When the sun goes down's when I wake up
When the sun goes down, get my bands up
When the sun goes down, I'm on the hunt
When the sun goes down, I can feel something
Forever young, I just wanna be forever dumb
I just wanna ride with gang in a hearse truck (Skrrt, skrrt)
Cut my wings if I don't keep my heart strong
Robin wings, I'm in pain, dead by dawn
Lately, how I'm living, I don't give a fuck

We them dumb motherfuckers
We them bad day havers
We them big knife holders
I guess one day it gets better
But 'til then, we keep them silencers

[Verse 1: Sematary]
Drink cotton candy Rockstar, hit me up on Tumblr
True Religion rockers with cardboard box cutters
Shawty, I'm a snuffer, she want me to fuck her
She want me to love her and bury her down under
As above, so below, just the wind remembers
Black smoke up in my lungs, I'm a stupid rotter
Listening to Silencer, never trust no one
If you wanna fuck with us, you're a fucking goner

Lurking in the fallen snow
Breathin' hard, phone broke
Gated residential home
Somethin' stirring eyes wide
Finna make you disappear
Fear what we can't hide
Hoping they don't find me here
In the cold, red clouds from the brake lights
Set the stage, this gon' be a long night
Haunted Mound, Silent Hill when we come around
No face, no case, 'cause you know we pull up with them—

When the sun goes down I pray
Pray to all the saints that I know
I say, "Thank you" to the pain
And all the love walking me home

I beg to sleep
Close my eyes feel a silhouette over me, over me
Close my eyes feel a silhouette over me, o-o-o-over me

[Verse 2]
When the sun goes up I sing
Sing with all thе house sparrows
A song to call all the saints
So they can watch from thе window

Close my eyes feel a silhouette over me, over me

26 STAND YOUR GROUND Lyrics[Chorus: Sematary & Ghost Mountain]
I told Ghost to bring the pressure on down
Said, "What you mean?" I said, "Stand your damn ground"
Bro played with me so I'ma bring the house down
Just like Bill Wilkins, this is my house
No dirty cops, I stand my ground
You can't come in, you ain't ready for the house
Come up in here, make it August Underground
It's just us, all up in the tree house

[Verse 1: Sematary]
Sematary, Ghost Mountain, we got so much hate
The dead will walk the earth, I cannot even wait
We come from the damn dirt, we are fueled by pain
I see seraphims, thirty girls in thirty graves

[Verse 2: Ghost Mountain]
Breakin' down your back door with a fire axe
Nails in my mouth, singing through my Scream mask
Night vision game cam up a dark path
Grave House, this a bloodbath

[Chorus: Sematary & Ghost Mountain]
I told Ghost to bring the pressure on down
Said, "What you mean?" I said, "Stand your damn ground"
Bro played with me so I'ma bring the house down
Just like Bill Wilkins, this is my house
No dirty cops, I stand my ground
You can't come in, you ain't ready for the house

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
I've been up for several days
Seeing shadows, Plato's Cave
Break my brain, I'm sleep depraved (Break)
Got too deep, carried away
I'm a fucking scarecrow, find me at the gallows
Ripped and torn my old clothes, True Religion cargos
Bridges made of rainbows, passing through the meadows
Dying with my shadow under weeping willows
Bare branches spike into the sky
Dropping down to your knees, God only knows that I've tried (That I've tried)
And I don't know if I'll make it out to the other side 'cause I'm always wakin' up, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

We stay turnt up in the field, if only I had a brain
You say you got some friends, but they all fade away (Bye-bye)
Got you off that fear gas, now you see it’s all fake (No, no)
Rockin' burlap mask, you gonna see me today (Ahh)
Post up in the windmill, that's where I like to stay
It’s the Dark Night of the Scarecrow, I feel like Bubba (Bubba)
Got them Truey Jeans on, you know I rock that Buddha
Wind blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow (Ohh)
Scarecrow strong, strong, strong, strong, strong, strong
Meadows turn to ash, green grass turn to rot
And I might be a strawman, but they will never burn me down

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
Robitussin, we fucked up
I'm fucked up off 4 drugs
That sun's up and you better run
There's a body bag stuffed in the trunk
Could a corpse lying dead, cold, stiff and sedate
Even cry in the bed that it once lay awake?
I don't know, but there's a leaking, weeping, dark red stain
Scrub the sheets, cleaning, bleaching, peeling off the decay
How you gonna crawl away from a gunshot?
Skewered with an oak tree branch I just sawed off
Almost autumn, I'm just counting all the leaves fall
You'll be hidden, you'll be missing, on a poster, dead and gone
All these wings up on my jeans, I'm not tryna go to heaven
I'm just tryna be released, heart beating with a hammer
[Pre-Chorus: Sematary]
Suffering for my wrist though
In my Butcher House, blood on the walls
When I die, bury me in smoke
So in peace my soul will go
I'ma get a Breitling
I'm all alone, bitch, fuck it all
If I die, bury it in my tomb
So my wrist will be icy though (Aaaaagh)

[Chorus: Sematary]
Suffer my wrist, suffer my wrist
Suffer my wrist, yeah
Suffer my wrist
Your lil wrist suffering, begging like Jesus, yeah
Suffer my wrist, suffer my neck
Die for my wrist, yeah
Look at my wrist
Diamonds show blood like crucifixion
Blood of the lamb
Pour it out over my wrist, yeah
Suffer my wrist
I do not suffer no bitch, nah

Curse the fucking town
Ahh

[Chorus]
Follow me, I'll take ya' down where the fucking trees frown
Tweakin' all night, turnt up in a treehouse
Sleepwalkin' through the woods, burnt it to the fucking ground
We don't ever leave a trace, we don't even make a sound
Follow me, I'll take ya' down where the fucking trees frown
Tweakin' all night, turnt up in a treehouse
Sleepwalkin' through the woods, burnt it to the fucking ground
We don't ever leave a trace, we don't even make a sound

[Verse 1]
Placе a hex upon this cursed fucking town
Floatin' face-down in thе river where I drown
In the coven, witches dancin' all around
Maypole, dancin' all around
Fire started in the barn, buried underneath the farm
Somethin' comin' out the corn
Give me shelter from the storm
In the meadows down below
Curse the crops, don't let them grow
Manifest the Holy Ghost, leaving foot-prints in the snow
Screamin' out a malediction
Expel the ghost, an eviction
Candle burns from the inside
Open my eyes to the bright light outside

[Verse 2]
Carve a sigil on my wrist
Summoned somethin' out the mist
Crawlin' up out of the crypt
To the soil, I commit
Take my life, now I'm livin' for the dead
Found my body under rocks beneath the riverbed
I was blacking out underneath the pine tree
Over the hills and down through the valley
I was fucked up, I heard trees screamin' out
I was on a bender, I was almost breakin' down
I saw shadow people, now they never come around
We were turnin' up all night in the treehouse

[Chorus]
Follow me, I'll take ya' down where the fucking trees frown
Tweakin' all night, turnt up in a treehouse

You don't really understand the importance but
Sometimes when I drive through these streets at night
I could smell the pain of all these people living in here
I could smell how these people are trapped in their lives, their day to day lives (Flex, flex, flex, my rock 'n' roll, ah)
They don’t see much (Flex, flex, flex, my rock 'n' roll, ah)
Sometimes they get lost in it, other times they just, they just feel lost
I could feel that pain like coming from these trees, these houses
I could feel that pain and it hurts me to think that I live such a balanced life
All these people going to work going to pray on Sunday's
Playing with their children
I never quite understand that
Why anyone would choose to live that way

And when her red lips smile she gets me everytime

And it's plain to see

Ah, I hear the wind when it's screamin’ to me, oh
And I be knowin' when you're lyin’ to me, oh
I hear your friends fuckin' laughin' at me, haha
Laugh all you want, I'll break in your airstream
And what I ain't, I will never be
It's like a dream burning through the trees
For me, you don't have to be pretty
But tonight, come with me in the trees

I’m from the woods wherе the dirt still bleeds
Where thе power lines shorter than the trees
I got safety pins, keep you safe for me
But, baby, I want you to bleed for me
All I ask for is you believe in me
And every night, hammer your kisses to me
Everybody leaves, will you stay true for me?
Fuck it though, I’ma make my chainsaw swing
Baby, when I go, will you wait for me?
If you look for me, you will find me
Baby, when I go, will you wait for me?
I'll be down by the river and the trees

18 WINDOW Lyrics[Intro]
Some' crawlin' past the window (Window)
Hauntaholics, Real haunted mound
Gonerville
Some' crawlin' past the window
Gon' mount his head on the mantle
Zippo spark like a candle

[Chorus]
Some' crawlin' past the window (Window)
Gon' mount his head on the mantle (Mantle)
Zippo spark like a candle (Candle)
I use my candles for the ritual (For the ritual)
For thee wanna try me (Wanna try me)
On my life, they can't handle (Can't handle)
I wear your bones like some antlers (Like some antlers)
Crush beneath me, mount ya' head on the mantle

[Verse 1]
Turnabout, I'on give a fuck
Still givin' sutures, stomp your head into the fuckin' mud (Mud)
Call up Grave Man for the Reds 'cause that's my fucking plug
Buck still off the oxy and I'm pouring up that human blood
What? Give a fuck, I double up my cup
Call me "Toseína Turnabout," I'm all about the mud
Skin your family for my trench coat, put the bones up in the truck
True off ketamine, I'm off the lean, Buck on the nostril dust
Pourin' blood up out my mouth until the silver turns to rust
Took his head for acting up and filled it up with fucking slugs
Turnabout, I say my name 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' thug
Lord of Ephraim, I'm the king of Utah, no one stepping up

Just a month ago, I was posted with the bros
Seen somethin' grown walking past the window (Past the window)
Had to grab my pole, I'ma make another soul
Killed another man, I'm thinkin' that it's time to fucking go (Let's fucking go)
Haunted Mound blood course my veins
Harold on my forearm hold my AR15 (Baow, baow, baow, baow, baow)
Fuck my bitch for the ritual, then scorch the plains
I told you once, won't tell you twice, no fucking with me (Don't fuck with me)
So don't come my way, no, not even close
Hit up Grave Man, talkin' 'bout "Oh, no" (Oh, no)
When it's time to go, bury me in smoke (Me in smoke)
Then remember who was walkin' past the window

Some' crawlin' past the window
Gon' mount his head on the mantle
